# Agent Orientation

For interoperability, we will always use README.md instead of AGENTS.md so that humans and agents can find all the important details and instructions in a standard, human-and-machine-readable format.

## Why README.md?

- **Standard Format**: README.md is the universal standard for project documentation
- **Human & Machine Readable**: Works for both human developers and automated agents
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates confusion between multiple documentation files
- **Better Discoverability**: Standard location that all tools and platforms expect
- **Maintenance**: Easier to keep one comprehensive document current

Please read the main **`README.md`** file for complete project orientation.
